# Customer Segmentation 🧩
A Python-based machine learning project that applies clustering techniques to segment customers into meaningful groups. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and visualization — all wrapped in a modular structure with reproducible workflows.

# 📌 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a key step in marketing analytics, helping businesses understand customer behavior and tailor strategies. This project uses K-Means clustering and other ML techniques to group customers based on purchasing patterns and demographic features
